## üéØ Purpose
### The reason for choosing to talk about this topic: 
1. Cardiovascular diseases encompass a range of disorders that affect the heart and blood vessels.
2. Globally, Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, as reported by the World Health Organization.
3. Numerous factors contribute to the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Analyzing the provided data through a regression analysis model allows us to identify which factors have the most significant impact.
4. Furthermore, regression analysis stands out as the most frequently used technique in machine learning. According to the National Library of Medicine, machine learning significantly improves the accuracy of predicting cardiovascular risk.

## üìä Dataset Descriptionc
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and is titled Cardiovascular Disease Dataset. It includes a wide range of health and lifestyle variables collected from patient records, such as:
- Demographic information (e.g., age, sex)
- Clinical measurements (e.g., BMI, blood pressure)
- Behavioral factors (e.g., physical activity, smoking, alcohol use)
- Mental health indicators (e.g., depression)

The dataset was already cleaned and free of missing values. 
For this project, I focused on a subset of variables believed to be most relevant to cardiovascular risk based on domain knowledge and initial correlation analysis. The predictors used were:
Exercise, Depression, Sex, Age Category, BMI, Smoking History, and Alcohol Consumption. 
This feature selection helped simplify the model, improve interpretability, and focus the analysis on lifestyle and behavioral risk factors.

## üß™ Analysis & Methodology
To model the likelihood of cardiovascular disease occurrence, I employed three binary classification models:
- Logistic regression (logit link)
- Probit regression
- Complementary log-log (cloglog) regression
  
To validate the results, models were implemented in both RStudio and SAS.

Model performance was evaluated using the following information criteria:
- Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
- Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
- Corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc)
  
The probit regression model consistently yielded the lowest AIC, BIC, and AICc values, indicating it provided the best fit among the three. As a result, the probit model was selected as the final model for interpretation and prediction.

Interpretation of Estimated Regression Coefficient:
Males have a 0.412838 higher z-score of estimated probability of developing cardiovascular disease than females. Engaging in regular exercise decreases the z-score by 0.267145. Conversely, depression raises the z- score by 0.311835, and smoking increases the z-score by 0.258597. Besides, young people have a lower z-score than the elderly. Additionally, for each unit increase in BMI, the estimated z-score rises by 0.014392.
